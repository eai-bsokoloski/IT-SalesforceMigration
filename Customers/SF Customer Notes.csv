Hi Nathan,
Thank you for talking with me a few minutes ago on the phone. As promised, I wanted to follow up with an email about the service and support plan.
Because we have had a few challenges with the hand add station and we missed the mark in having it ready for your site, we are extending our normal “one year of free support” to three years of free support. This support is currently a value of $6,058 each year, so the total value is a touch over $12,000.
This support plan includes free business hour phone support, reduced costs for after-hours phone calls, and updates to your software as they are available and necessary. We appreciate your patience in working with us and we look forward to implementing the hand add station around the April timeframe.
If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me.
Sincerely,
Jayden Grupe","Free Additional Support (2 Years)"

They are also having issues when running their flaker, as the steam quality and quantity changes and the pelleter runs differently. They are working with a company there to redo some of their steam system and add a new condensator to help the quality of steam. 
Dave said that when they were at the right steps for this, they would let us know so we can work on getting the right sized valve in place for them as well. I am going to check in about every month or so with them to get it figured out. ","Check-In Call 2-6-2020 Dave Labs"

Andy,
We actually got the bad computer to work if I remember correctly.  Wasn’t sure if we need to keep the extra PC as a backup, or send it back?
Thanks,

Eric,
You can definitely keep that for a back up batcher computer. We would normally charge if you ended up keeping it instead of returning it, but you can keep this one no charge. This backup computer will be void of any warranty from EAI. Should the computer fail the purchase of a replacement would be required. The lifespan of a batcher computer is generally 2-5 years. Since Feed Mill environments vary it is difficult to say how long your computer will last.","Email 11/21/19"

"Dail Farms Inc. ","1989180","Ashley Sauck","I went to Dail Farms last week and started from Tuesday morning until Friday early afternoon. I got the following working: 1) Their new alternate mixer unload path logic (added a leg, mixerunload that shares a VFD, surge switch, and surge unload) tested and batching 2) Their diverter logic was broken. This is something I’ve fixed I know a few times before. 3) Found out that their PLC doesn’t seem to be ‘creating boot project’ either entirely, or intermittently. Codesys produces an error every time I try though. 4) When logging in a program, after a shutdown, I know the program is different, however codesys logs in without loading the new program. This tricks me/whoever in thinking that the program I’m looking at in codesys is the one their PLC is running I *think this warrants them needing a new PLC. 5) Timers were not set up. Again, I feel like I have fixed this before, but did it again. 6) Hammermill cleanout based on high level was fixed. Again, thought I have fixed and tested. 7) Main scale vibrator added and uses logic of a more advanced vibrator timing function block 8) Applies other vibrators to the new function block to allow the mill to weighup much more continuously 9) Grinder feeder speeds weren’t working and fixed them. 10) Mixer empty by weight functionality allows the 3 stage system to work because feed drops from the mixer into an unload and NOT directly into the surge (i.e., we can’t just trust that in a short duration that the mixer is empty) 11) We changed scale filtering for the mixer scale. It is probably as high as we want it to go. Todd is going to see if they can physically fix something that might be vibrating on the mixer. I’m not 100% if feed sloshing in the mixer might also be causing the problem.
Things that I was unable to get working:1) Loadout pro is installed, however we were unable to forward the serial port of the remote loadout PC to the batcher server. This is something Chad C and I will dig into to get working. I tried setting up loadout pro on the remote machine and it was slow. At the moment, they’re not using LOP. That said, I do have the remote machine connected and reading the serial port from the truck scale.2) Didn’t have time to set up email notifications, but that can be done remotely3) I’m not yet sure why their HDMI port on their PC doesn’t send video out. We changed the BIOS so that both the onboard and peripheral video cards should be sending video. 4) There is something weird about their wireless mouse and windows server. It sees the mouse moving sometimes, but doesn’t click.","Email from Greg to Jayden/Ashley 10/8/19"

This will be a bit different in the fact we’ll also need to get rid of the ‘old one’, since I set it up for them with the old ticket.
In ‘theory’ the only thing they’ll need is the report setting, but at their sister company we also set it up as a Custom report so they could go hand-print it if they really needed to.
First let’s go with the relevant portions of NGC file anatomy…
The Server Store:   C:\Program Files\EasyAutomation\Batcher.Server\server_store     contains:
Custom Images
Custom Reports
Override Reports.
Any Report that doesn’t traditionally live in the ‘Reports Menu’ structure
Delivery Tickets
HA Station Tickets
Hand Add Tickets
Mix Tickets
Post Batch Reports
Custom Reports – AKA Totally new report for a customer, not intended to ‘physically replace’ another report (though its existence may cause them to no longer ‘need’ another report) //This definition will make more sense when we get to the concept of Override Reports in later training that is irrelevant to Orangeville.
Anything you place in C:\Program Files\EasyAutomation\Batcher.Server\server_store\custom_reports\     will, upon next restart of the client, show up in Reports>Custom Reports>
Orangeville’s report does not have a Header file, but in general when you place a file here, you will need to add the header file that development gives you as well.
We can probably delete the old one, at least once we know the new works.
Report Settings / Post Batch Report
Anything you place in the C:\Program Files\EasyAutomation\Batcher.Server\server_store\postbatch_reports will be available as an option when you are creating a ‘Report Setting’ for reports of type ‘Post Batch Report’
Orangeville’s report does not have a Header file, but in general when you place a file here, you will need to add the header file that development gives you as well.
We can probably delete the old one, at least once we know the new works.
Report Settings: (A good Read can be found here: https://redmine.easy-automation.com/projects/eai-software-development/wiki/Report_Settings)
Add: (in Orangeville’s case ‘Edit’)

Folder/Directory that EAI exports to
This can be found in the documentation attached. But you will find there are 4 folders in \\10.22.0.4\Sage_EA_Integrations where transfers occur. They include: FOE_MO_Receipt, FOE_MO_Loaded, FOE_PO_Receipt, and FOE_ICT.
If there are specific people you’d like to have access to those directories, you’ll have to work with Andrew on that.
Do note, these are the directories that NetAtWork periodically (configurable?) pulls from so I would regard these as “hot folders”.
There is a Task Scheduler to run a bat file to move files from one folder to another called TRANSFER TO SAGE CLOUD MACHINE.  After a reboot of the server, if orders don't move back to Sage, check to see that this is running.  May need to manually trigger it until the ""start at 4:00 am"" trigger is reached again. ","Sage Integration"

Matthew was a little difficult in the beginning, but the fact that he is happy with little complaint on issue below. I’d say this is a great win for us 😊
Michele,
Matthew let me know if he has mentioned this, one thing about a low inventory list on the main screen. He said he has to close out and open back up for it to update that list. On FOPro it did that automatically without closing out of the screen. I told him you’ve probably mentioned this to development if he already told you about it. I just want Jayden and Kory to be aware of this, but he said that is his only comment about FOE that he would fix. Probably a development thing?
Michele's response: 
Yes, Matthew did mention that to me. It is a know issue in FOE- not only on the main screen, but all windows. That is one of the reasons there is a refresh button at the top of the screen. I agree that is annoying, but at this point we do not have a fix for that.","SO 701927 FOE closeout call"

"Nutrius Animal Nutrition Hereford","2289927","Jacy Kosbab","All,
Nutrius in Hereford TX is having issues with the MQTT messaging for their HA Station. It appears as if it just stops working – it wont show hand adds in batch or not in batch. There is an easy fix to get them going again. Take the following steps:
Shut down NGC, and the HMI. Stop the NGC Service. NGC clients should be closed as well.
For the following folders, zip the current folder, then delete the existing one. Once NGC and the HMI restart these folders will be recreated. These file paths may not be exact for the customer site. The important thing is to find these folders:  hmi_mqtt, activemq-data, and the other activemq-data.
C:\Program Files\EasyAutomation\Batcher.Server\hmi_mqtt
C:\Program Files\EasyAutomation\activemq-data\
C:\Program Data\EasyAutomation\activemq-data
Once those folders no longer exist, start the NGC service, NGC, and the HMI.
-Start the batching system back up again, and confirm the HA station is sending requests for hand adds in batch.
It appears that this has had to be done twice in the last few months, so unless the root cause can be found this will need to be done again at some point.
Bob Gibbs
A small correction to this. Just delete the contents of these folders.

Bill mentioned that he believes it has been slower since they did a purge. Chad also moved a 1GB database from folder to folder on the computer, and it ran incredibly slow even when FBPro was not running. 
We would like to put a benchmark program on their computer to test it for performance. Phil wants to check to make sure they are only running on the shortcut that lets it only run on one core in the computer. That was not checked when we logged in the other day. 
Next steps: 
1) Log in with Reicks View and install a program to benchmark their computer performance and see if there are issues. 
2) Check the affinity of the shortcut to FBPro they are currently using. 
3) Check why they are overrunning feed sometimes--is there an issue with a sensor or switch somewhere? Distributor is switching too early. ","Summary Of Issues 2-20-2019"

"Valley View Milling LLC","1992624","Jayden Grupe","From John Clymer: 
Dylan put in a 2 way and a feed cleaner on the pelleting line at Valley View this week.
Dale contacted me just after 5 last night because of 1 minor tweak needed to the PLC, easy day, no biggy.
HOWEVER – What I found out AFTER they plugged the pellet mill worries me.  Per Dale from EBM, they have the fines return from the feed cleaner ran directly into the conditioner, bypassing the screw feeder entirely.  This will be extremely problematic.  We have no control over the rate at which the fines get put back into the conditioner, so if there is ever a slug of fines that comes through the system, the pellet mill is guaranteed to plug.
The ideal spot for this would be at the end of the feeder screw, so as the fines come around, they get sucked up into the feed screw before the source bin dumps in.  Second best place would be before the bins.
HOWEVER – even this arrangement isn’t a good arrangement, as they have a feeder screw feeding into a feeder screw.  When the secondary feeder is in use, the primary runs at full speed (which was a desired change from before when we had the primary running just slightly faster than the secondary screw feeder.)
The best arrangement for Valley View would be to have a secondary screw feeder just for the fines, this would be on a VFD so that we can control the rate of the fines coming into the conditioner.
Just thought the pelleting guru’s should be aware of this, as I have a feeling there will be some calls on this over the next few weeks.","Pelleting Concerns With Fines"

"Yorktown Organic Feed Tampico","1994179","Stacie Shaw","When updating NGO, need softclient files updated on 3 machines: Yorktown Afton-BATCHER (in GTA), Yorktown Billing PC NEW (in GTA), and Yorktown Tampico -BATCHER (offline in GTA, so they need to get you in). 
From the FOE Server computer (YORKTOWNRDS19), you can access shared EAI-apps folder on the Tampico BATCHER, but need admin password to use Task Manager.  From the Tampico-Billing, you can access the entire C:\\EasyAutomation shared folder on the FOE Server computer. The Afton BATCHER does not have access to any of the shared folders so need to transfer files. ","Softclient files"
